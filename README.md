# travel app

this is a course project for udacity front end web developer program

## Introduction about the app

The project will include a simple form where you enter the location you are traveling to and the date you are leaving. If the trip is within a week, you will get the current weather forecast. If the trip is in the future, you will get a predicted forecast. The OpenWeather API is fantastic but it doesn’t let you get future data for free and it’s not that flexible with what information you enter; we are going to use the Weatherbit API for you to see how another API accomplishes the same goals. Weatherbit API has one problem, it only takes in coordinates for weather data -- it’s that specific. So, we’ll need to get those coordinates from the Geonames API. Once we have all of this data, we’ll want to display an image of the location entered; for this, we will be using the Pixabay API.

## how to run the app

Download zip file to local environment. run Git i to install all packages, npm run build-dev to start development server, and npm start for express. Open localhost:8080 in the brwoser, and you can start playing with it!
